# Important Notice

- Translation keys inside the `application` namespace should not be edited!!!
- These keys are stored in the database and have to be resolvable.
- If you change these keys, labels of old applications can not be resolved anymore.
- Labels that can be changed because they are not stored in the database were put in other namespaces f.e. "applicationForms".
