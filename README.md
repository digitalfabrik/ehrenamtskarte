## What is a _Ehrenamtskarte_?

Short answer: a benefit card for volunteers in Bavaria, Germany.

Translated from [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenamtskarte):

>The Ehrenamtskarte (also Ehrenamtspass) is a personal document in Germany that serves as proof of special 
> voluntary commitment. Such a document can be issued, for example, by the state, federal states, 
> municipalities or volunteer agencies.
>
> Depending on how it is implemented, it may be linked to documentation of the type and scope of the activity, 
> the skills required for it and any qualification measures. An Ehrenamtskarte or Freiwilligenausweis can also bring 
> certain benefits, such as discounts on tickets or access to museums or other public institutions, or benefits 
> with cooperation partners, such as companies, institutions and other supporters.
