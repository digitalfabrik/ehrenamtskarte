# Style and coding conventions

## Frontend

We follow the official [effective dart guides](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart).

Our linting rules are checked in the pipeline as well as in most IDEs. To configure them, see the [official dart docs](https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options) and the [effective_dart package](https://pub.dev/packages/effective_dart) docs on how to edit the [analysis_options.yaml](../frontend/analysis_options.yaml).
